A collection of libraries, a pipeline plugin, and a CDAP service for performing data
cleansing, transformation, and filtering using a set of data manipulation instructions
(directives). These instructions are either generated using an interative visual tool or
are manually created.

  * Data Prep defines few concepts that might be useful if you are just getting started with it. Learn about them [here](wrangler-docs/concepts.md)
  * The Data Prep Transform is [separately documented](wrangler-transform/wrangler-docs/data-prep-transform.md).
  * [Data Prep Cheatsheet](wrangler-docs/cheatsheet.md)

## New Features

More [here](wrangler-docs/upcoming-features.md) on upcoming features.

  * **User Defined Directives, also known as UDD**, allow you to create custom functions to transform records within CDAP DataPrep or a.k.a Wrangler. CDAP comes with a comprehensive library of functions. There are however some omissions, and some specific cases for which UDDs are the solution. Additional information on how you can build your custom directives [here](wrangler-docs/custom-directive.md).
    * Migrating directives from version 1.0 to version 2.0 [here](wrangler-docs/directive-migration.md)
    * Information about Grammar [here](wrangler-docs/grammar/grammar-info.md)
    * Various `TokenType` supported by system [here](../api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/TokenType.java)
    * Custom Directive Implementation Internals [here](wrangler-docs/udd-internal.md)

  * A new capability that allows CDAP Administrators to **restrict the directives** that are accessible to their users.
More information on configuring can be found [here](wrangler-docs/exclusion-and-aliasing.md)

## Demo Videos and Recipes

Videos and Screencasts are best way to learn, so we have compiled simple, short screencasts that shows some of the features of Data Prep. Additional videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhmsf-NvXKJn-neqefOrcl4n7zU4TWmIr)

## Performance

Initial performance tests show that with a set of directives of high complexity for
transforming data, *DataPrep* is able to process at about ~106K records per second. The
rates below are specified as *records/second*. 

| Directive Complexity | Column Count |    Records |           Size | Mean Rate |
| -------------------- | :----------: | ---------: | -------------: | --------: |
| High (167 Directives) |      426      | 127,946,398 |  82,677,845,324 | 106,367.27 |
| High (167 Directives) |      426      | 511,785,592 | 330,711,381,296 | 105,768.93 |
