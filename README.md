A collection of libraries, a pipeline plugin, and a CDAP service for performing data
cleansing, transformation, and filtering using a set of data manipulation instructions
(directives). These instructions are either generated using an interative visual tool or
are manually created.

The Data Prep Transform is [separately documented](transform/docs/data-prep-transform.md).

## Concepts

This implementation of Data Prep uses the concepts of _Record_, _Column_, _Directive_,
_Step_, and _Pipeline_.

### Record

A *Record* is a collection of field names and field values.

### Column

A *Column* is a data value of any of the supported Java types, one for each record.

### Directive

A *Directive* is a single data manipulation instruction, specified to either transform,
filter, or pivot a single record into zero or more records. A directive can generate one
or more *steps* to be executed by a pipeline.

### Step

A *Step* is an implementation of a data transformation function, operating on a single
record or set of records. A step can generate zero or more records from the application of
a function.

### Pipeline

A *Pipeline* is a collection of steps to be applied on a record. The record(s) outputed
from a step are passed to the next step in the pipeline.


## Notations

### Directives

A directive can be represented in text in this format:

```
<command> <argument-1> <argument-2> ... <argument-n>
```

### Record

A record in this documentation will be shown as a JSON object with an object key
representing the column names and a value shown by the plain representation of the
the data, without any mention of types.

For example:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "fname": "root",
  "lname": "joltie",
  "address": {
    "housenumber": "678",
    "street": "Mars Street",
    "city": "Marcity",
    "state": "Maregon",
    "country": "Mari"
  },
  "gender": "M"
}
```

## Performance

Initial performance tests show that with a set of directives of medium complexity for
transforming data, *DataPrep* is able to process at about 60K records per second. The
rates below are specified as *records/second*. Additional details and test results
[are available](docs/performance.md).

| Directive Complexity | Column Count |    Records |           Size | Mean Rate | 1 Minute Rate | 5 Minute Rate | 15 Minute Rate |

## Data Prep Service

Data Prep is integrated as a CDAP Service to support HTTP RESTful-based interactive
wrangling of data. The main objective of this service is to make it simple and easy to
interactively apply the directives required for parsing a given data set. The service is
not intended to replace full-scale big data processing; it is primarily used to
interactively apply directives on a sample of your data.

The base endpoint is:

```
http://<hostname>:11015/v3/namespaces/<namespace>/apps/dataprep/services/service/methods
```

These services are provided:

* [Administration and Management](docs/service/admin.md)
* [Directive Execution](docs/service/execution.md)
* [Column Type Detection and Statistics](docs/service/statistics.md)
* [Column Name Validation](docs/service/validation.md)

The [Request Format Specification](docs/service/request.md) describes the format that is used for sending
a request to the back-end.


## Building New Directives

As directives are executed as a step, it's a simple three-part process to implement the step and
provide the specifications for a directive.

### Part 1 of 3

In order to add a new step, implement the interface 'Step':
```
/**
 * A interface defining a Data Prep step in a pipeline.
 */
public interface Step {
  /**
   * Executes a Data Prep step on each {@link Record} and returns an array of processed {@link Record Records}.
   *
   * @param records the list of input {@link Record Records} to be processed by this step
   * @return the list of processed {@link Record Records}
   * @throws StepException if a step exception occurred
   */
  List<Record> execute(List<Record> records) throws StepException;
}
```

### Part 2 of 3

Add a comprehensive test case for the directive that has been added.

### Part 3 of 3

Modify the specification to parse the directive specification and create the implementation of
the step you have created in part 1.


## Build

To build your plugin:
```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

The build will create a `.jar` and `.json` file under the `target` directory for the
`wrangler-transform` and a `.jar` file for the `wrangler-service` application. These files
can be used to deploy your plugin and the wrangler backend.


## Deployment

You can deploy your plugin using the CDAP CLI:
```
> load artifact target/wrangler-transform-<version>.jar config-file target/wrangler-transform-<version>.json
```

For example, if your artifact is named `wrangler-transform-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`:
```
> load artifact target/wrangler-transform-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar config-file target/wrangler-transform-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.json
```
