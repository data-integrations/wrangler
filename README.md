Collection of libraries, pipeline plugin and CDAP service for performing data cleansing, transformation and filtering using a set of instructions. Instructions to manipulate data are either generated using an interative visual tool or could be manually entered.

## Concepts

This implementation of wrangler defines the following concepts. Please familiarize yourself with these concepts. 

### Record

A Record is a collection of field names and field values. 

### Column

A Column is a data value of any supported java type, one for each Record.

### Directive

A Directive is a single data manipulation instruction specified to either transform, filter or pivot a single record into zero or more records. A directive can generate one or more Steps to be executed by the Pipeline. 

### Step

A Step is a implementation of a data transformation function operating on a Record or set of records. A step can generate zero or more Records from the application of a function. 

### Pipeline

A Pipeline is a collection of Steps to be applied on a Record. Record(s) outputed from each Step is passed to the next Step in the pipeline. 

## Notations

### Directives

A directive is represented as simple text in the format as specified below
```
  <command> <argument-1> <argument-2> ... <argument-n>
```

### Record

A record in this documentation will be representation as json object with object key representing the column names and the value representing the plain representation of the the data without any mention of types. 

E.g.
```
{
  "id" : 1,
  "fname" : "root",
  "lname" : "joltie",
  "address" : {
    "housenumber" : "678",
    "street" : "Mars Street",
    "city" : "Marcity",
    "state" : "Maregon",
    "country" : "Mari"
  }
  "gender", "M"
}
```

## Performance

Initial performance tests shows that with medium set of directives for transforming data, wrangler is able to process at ~ 60K records/second. The rates below are specified as '**records/second**'. More details and test results will be available [here](docs/performance.md)

| Directive Complexity | Column Count| Records | Size | Mean Rate | 1 Minute Rate | 5 Minute Rate | 15 Minute Rate |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Medium | 18 | 13,499,973 | 4,499,534,313 | 64,998.50 | 64,921.29 | 46,866.70 | 36,149.86 | 
| Medium | 18 | 80,999,838 | 26,997,205,878 | 62,465.93 | 62,706.39 | 60,755.41 | 56,673.32 | 

## Wrangler Service

Wrangler is integrated as a CDAP Service to support REST based interactive ways to wrangle data. The main objective of having this service is to make it easy for interactively generating directives required for parsing data. This service does not support full scale big data processing.

The base endpoint is defined below :

```
  http://<hostname>:11015/v3/namespaces/<namespace>/apps/wrangler/services/service/methods
```

Following are different services provided:

* [Administration and Management](docs/service/admin.md)
* [Directive Execution](docs/service/execution.md)
* [Column Type Detection and Statistics](docs/service/statistics.md)
* [Column Name Validation](docs/service/validation.md)

## Build new directives

Directives are executed as a step, so it's a simple three step process to actually implement the Step and
provide the specification for directive.

### Step 1/3
In order to add a new step, implement the interface 'Step'.
```
/**
 * A interface defining the wrangle step in the wrangling pipeline.
 */
public interface Step {
  /**
   * Executes a wrangle step on single {@link Row} and return an array of wrangled {@link Row}.
   *
   * @param records List of input {@link Record} to be wrangled by this step.
   * @return Wrangled list of {@link Record}.
   * @throws StepException In case of any issue this exception is thrown.
   */
  List<Record> execute(List<Record> records) throws StepException;
}
```

### Step 2/3
Add comprehensive test case for testing the directive that has been added. 

### Step 3/3

Modify the specification to parse the directive specification and create the implementation of
Step you have created above.

## Build
To build your plugins:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory for wrangler-transform and .jar for wrangler-service application. These files can be used to deploy your plugins and wrangler backend.


## Deployment
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/wrangler-transform-<version>.jar> config-file <target/wrangler-transform-<version>.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'wrangler-transform-<version>':

    > load artifact target/wrangler-transform-<version>.jar config-file target/wrangler-transform-<version>.json

## Mailing Lists

CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:

- `cdap-user@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user>`__

The *cdap-user* mailing list is primarily for users using the product to develop
applications or building plugins for appplications. You can expect questions from 
users, release announcements, and any other discussions that we think will be helpful 
to the users.
