Wrangler
--------
Wrangler plugin is processing the steps defined by the wrangler frontend. On the frontend it's a interactive tool for data cleansing and transformation.

Steps
-----
Following are the steps currently implemented

* Parser record as CSV
* Upper, Lower and Title case
* Index Split
* Drop a column
* Rename a column
* Set column names
* Set column types

Build
-----
To build your plugins:

    mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

UI Integration
--------------
The Cask Hydrator UI displays each plugin property as a simple textbox. To customize how the plugin properties
are displayed in the UI, you can place a configuration file in the ``widgets`` directory.
The file must be named following a convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].json``.

See [Plugin Widget Configuration](http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/hydrator-manual/developing-plugins/packaging-plugins.html#plugin-widget-json)
for details on the configuration file.

The UI will also display a reference doc for your plugin if you place a file in the ``docs`` directory
that follows the convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].md``.

When the build runs, it will scan the ``widgets`` and ``docs`` directories in order to build an appropriately
formatted .json file under the ``target`` directory. This file is deployed along with your .jar file to add your
plugins to CDAP.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/plugin.jar> config-file <target/plugin.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'my-plugins-1.0.0':

    > load artifact target/my-plugins-1.0.0.jar config-file target/my-plugins-1.0.0.json

Mailing Lists
-------------
CDAP User Group and Development Discussions:

- `cdap-user@googlegroups.com <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cdap-user>`__

The *cdap-user* mailing list is primarily for users using the product to develop
applications or building plugins for appplications. You can expect questions from 
users, release announcements, and any other discussions that we think will be helpful 
to the users.
