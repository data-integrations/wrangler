# Parse as CSV

The PARSE-AS-CSV is a directive for parsing an input record as comma-separated values.


## Syntax
```
parse-as-csv <column> <delimiter> [<header=true|false>]
```

The `<column>` specifies the column in the record that should be parsed as CSV using
the specified `<delimiter>`. If the values in the first record of the input need to be set as column
headers, set `<header>` to `true`; by default, it is set to `false`.


## Examples

Consider a single line from a consumer complaint CSV file. Each line of the CSV file is added as a record:
```
{
  "body": "07/29/2013,Consumer Loan,Vehicle Loan,Managing the loan or lease,,,,Wells Fargo & Company,VA,24540,,N/A,Phone,07/30/2013,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,468882"
}
```

Applying this directive:
```
parse-as-csv body ,
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": "07/29/2013,Consumer Loan,Vehicle Loan,Managing the loan or lease,,,Wells Fargo & Company,VA,24540,,N/A,Phone,07/30/2013,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,468882",
  "body_1": "07/29/2013",
  "body_2": "Consumer Loan",
  "body_3": "Vehicle Loan",
  "body_4": "Managing the loan or lease",
  "body_5": null,
  "body_6": null,
  "body_7": "Wells Fargo & Company",
  "body_8": "VA",
  "body_9": "24540",
  "body_10": null,
  "body_11": "N/A",
  "body_12": "Phone",
  "body_13": "07/30/2013",
  "body_14": "Closed with explanation",
  "body_15": "Yes",
  "body_16": "No",
  "body_17": "468882"
}
```

Using this record, with a header as the first record, as an example:
```
[
  {
    "body": "Date,Type,Item,Action,Company"
  },
  {
    "body": "07/29/2013,Consumer Loan,Vehicle Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Wells Fargo & Company"
  }
]
```

Applying this directive:
```
parse-as-csv body , true
```

would result in this record:
```
{
  "body": "07/29/2013,Consumer Loan,Vehicle Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Wells Fargo & Company"
  "Date": "07/29/2013",
  "Type": "Consumer Loan",
  "Item": "Vehicle Loan",
  "Action": "Managing the loan or lease",
  "Company": "Wells Fargo & Company"
}
```
